## Introduction

<!---
Introduce yourself, who are you? Where are you from? Why do you want to be a game programmer? What got you interested in game development? For example, you could tell about the moment in your life that you realized that you wanted to be a game programmer. 
-->
Hello, my name is Satyendra. I am 21 and I live in Rotterdam. I want to be become a game programmer to share my creativty and ideas with the world in an artistic and interactive way. I have been playing games all my youth till now. Titles like Xenoblade, Undertale and Nier made realise how you can share your ideals in such ways and make people realise something thay never would think about in a fun way.    
## Strengths

<!---
What are your strengths? What are you good at? Are you good in math? Do you like solving difficult problems? Do you consider yourself a critical thinker? Do you like to work in teams or do you do better as a solo flyer? What will you do to nourish your strengths?
-->
I think a lot about looking for diffrent solutions to make something. I also think I have good problem solving skills, which I can brainstorm about for some time ᕙ(⇀‸↼‶)ᕗ. I have no problems with working in a team and like to hear diffrent perspectives, but also need my own time to think things through and need to focus.   

## Weakness

<!---
What are you not so good at? What do you find difficult? What do you want to improve about yourself? How do you think you can realize those improvements?
-->
I'm not the best at communicating. I really think I should just let my thoughts out more. Also not so good at math. 

## Accomplishments

<!---
What are you proud of? Have you participated in any sports? Did you win any awards? Did you make something cool with your friends? Use this section to brag about yourself!
-->
I like to go to the gym and feel quit accomplished with how much I have shaped myself. I also like to do fighting sports.

And during my intership at a small game company I was assigned to come up with a mini game and create it from scratch and my work will make it in the products release.   
## Hobbies

<!---
What do you like doing in your spare time? What is your favorite video game (right now)? What kind of movies do you like? What kind of music do you like? Where is your favorite vacation spot?
-->
Mainly sports, gaming and other media. Currenlty I'm busy with Totk and Yakuza 0. My favorite videogame is still Xenoblade Chronicles 2 because of how broken you can equip yourself in the game with the buff combinations. 

For music i like hiphop, R&B, Asian pop/rock and Latin music. And with movies I like action, mysterie and animation. I really the movie into the spiderverse, not just because of the action but the soundtrack which was made by some of favorite artists. 

I like Italy a lot and went there once this vacation. Other than that I really would like to go to Japan or California. 

## Career Goals

<!---
What do you want to do when you graduate? What role do you see yourself in? Do you want to be the graphics programmer on your team or the gameplay programmer? Or maybe you are more interested in physics programming? Or maybe you'd just rather be the all-in-one guy that can help everyone in your team? Where do you want to work? Be specific! What companies appeal to you? Do you want to work in your home country or abroad? What steps do you need to take in order to acquire this job?
-->

I see myself function as a programmer then of course. At a AAA or indie game company, where I can hopefully work on a real blockbuster. I would love to work abroad to, since their are some Japanese studio's and creators I would just love to work with for example, Hideo Kojima, Yoko Taro, Suda 51 and Masahiro Sakurai.
