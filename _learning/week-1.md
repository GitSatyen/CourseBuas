This is a description of your learning experiences. You can use markdown like any other post.

## Plan

<!---
NOTE: Fill this section in at the beginning of the week!

What do you plan to do this week? What new knowledge do you want to acquire? Do you want to follow any of the learning units for the course? Do you want to work on the assignment for the course? How much time do you estimate you will spend on these tasks?
-->
This week I want to learn just how I can function like a professional progammer, required to enroll in the Creative Media and Game Technologies course. I'm willing to work as much as I can on this course. To be specific around 5/6 hours a day.   
## Do

<!---
NOTE: Fill this in during the week.

What were you actually able to accomplish? Was it more or less than what you planned? Was the amount of time you thought you would spend on it accurate? If not, what took longer than you thought it would?

Provide as much context as possible. Use code snippets or take screenshots of what you were able to accomplish. Please provide references to any additional sources of information that helped you.

This week I learned to setup visual studio for the project with all the libs 
that should be inlcuded like instructed. Also managed to make the bouncing ball
example project run, like instructed during the lecture. 

## Check

<!--- 
Note: Fill this in at the end of the week.

What went well? What didn't go so well? What was the most important thing you learned this week?

Did you receive any feedback from the lecturer or your peers? If so, what was that feedback? Were you able to incorporate that feedback?

Did you give anyone else feedback? Who did you give feedback to? How did they respond to your feedback?

NOTE: Any source of feedback is feedback!

Since there haven't been a lot of complecated programming been yet, everything went quit well. Also writing the GDD is going niceley and almost finsihed before the next lecture.   
## Act

<!---
Note: Fill this in at the end of the week.

What action points can you identify from this week? What would you like to improve? What would you like to continue to strengthen?

If your planned time estimates were not accurate, what would you do to improve them?

I would like to dive deeper into programming now, since we have a short amount of time for this project. 
I really do want to improve my programming skills to an expert level.
