This is a description of your learning experiences. You can use markdown like any other post.

## Plan

<!---
NOTE: Fill this section in at the beginning of the week!

What do you plan to do this week? What new knowledge do you want to acquire? Do you want to follow any of the learning units for the course? Do you want to work on the assignment for the course? How much time do you estimate you will spend on these tasks?
-->
Implementing gravity and working on the jumping physics. 
## Do

<!---
NOTE: Fill this in during the week.

What were you actually able to accomplish? Was it more or less than what you planned? Was the amount of time you thought you would spend on it accurate? If not, what took longer than you thought it would?

Provide as much context as possible. Use code snippets or take screenshots of what you were able to accomplish. Please provide references to any additional sources of information that helped you.

Implementing the gravity works but making the player jump doesn't work yet. Seems I need to change the structure to make the jump function.  
## Check 

<!--- 
Note: Fill this in at the end of the week.

What went well? What didn't go so well? What was the most important thing you learned this week?

Did you receive any feedback from the lecturer or your peers? If so, what was that feedback? Were you able to incorporate that feedback?

Did you give anyone else feedback? Who did you give feedback to? How did they respond to your feedback?

NOTE: Any source of feedback is feedback!
-->
Still trying to implement the jumping physics. The animation works only the player doesn't work. Also need to implement a function to detect if the player is on the ground or not and if its decending. 
## Act

<!---
Note: Fill this in at the end of the week.

What action points can you identify from this week? What would you like to improve? What would you like to continue to strengthen?

If your planned time estimates were not accurate, what would you do to improve them?
-->
Simplefied the gravity functionality and progress on the jumping physics. I  need to spend more time, since I haven't made much progress this far in into the course.
